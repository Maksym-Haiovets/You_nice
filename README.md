Every time the staff or organizer must manually check before enrolling a person for the procedure when it is he or she who can record that person, since there may already be many such records, it will take some time for the staff or the organizer to do so, the more the staff can already work on a certain order so they will have to ask the person wait until he calls her back, as a result the person has to wait, which is not comfortable for a person, and a person can find another salon.
